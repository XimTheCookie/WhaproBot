# WhaproBot
My small attempt at making a Discord Music Bot in Node.
Will get occasionally updated for new features and/or bugfixes, expecially since i use this myself.

# How to run
1. Install Node.JS (Bot was made using version 16.), you are free to us NVM.
2. Create your Discord Bot on https://discord.com/developers/applications (and invite it to your Discord server).
3. Download WhaproBot and extract the archive wherever you want.
4. Edit file src/configuration.json, you must add bot token and bot user id, otherwise it will not work.
5. Open the project folder in terminal and run "npm run build" to compile the project.
6. (Only once) run "npm run deploy-commands" to register bot's slash commands to Discord.
7. run "npm run start" to start bot.
